Neon is set to be a standalone 3D Model Viewer with a 
custom 3D Engine in OpenGL and later Vulksan or a Libary / API
to render 3D Graphics. 

### The goals of Neon are: 
    - Import OBJ Models
    - Camera to move around freely
    - Lighting, maybe Raytraced
    - Various GUI features in the Standalone Version
    - Debug Tools for Libary and Standalone use
